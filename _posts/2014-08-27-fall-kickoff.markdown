# Discussion: Upcoming Topics


The Berkeley chapter of the Hacker Within scientific computing group (formerly
known as the Berkeley NE computational methods group) will be kicking off the
fall 2014 semester on Wednesday, August 27th, from 4pm-6pm. 

The goal of this meeting will be to plan the rest of the semester's meetings.
The time, frequency, and content of the upcoming semester's meetings will all
be up for discussion. In particular, I am hoping we will be able to brainstorm
a possible suite of software tools, resources, and practices to discuss this
upcoming semester. If you have an idea, but won't make it to the meeting, reply
on the [UCB hackerwithin listhost][listhost].
