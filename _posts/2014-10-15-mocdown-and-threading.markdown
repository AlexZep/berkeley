## Discussion: MocDown

### George Zhang and Phil Gorman

George and Phil are both PhD students in the Berkeley neutronics group. 


### MocDown

[MocDown](http://ucb-rdn.github.io/projects/mocdown/mocdown.html) is a neutron 
transport, transmutation, thermal fluids, and equilibrium search tool developed 
here at Berkeley primarily by Jeffrey Seifried.

George and Phil covered :

- What does MocDown do?
- What is going on in the input files?

Code examples and documentation can be found at [the homepage](https://jeffseif.github.io/MocDown).

## Discussion: Threading with Python

### Ross Barnowski

Ross Barnowski is a PhD student in Kai Vetter's research group. His work 
focuses on nuclear instrumentation, including a 3D gamma ray imaging cart 
called the [Compact Compton Imager II](https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/schedule/presentation/1714/). 


### Threading in Python

Ross gave a talk that covered the concept of concurrency as well as how to make 
it happen in Python. 

Code examples can be found [here][threading].
