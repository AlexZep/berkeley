# Nuclear Data at LANL - Morgan White

We have a distinguished visitor for the last meetin of the semester. Morgan 
will give us some thoughts on Nuclear Data at Los Alamos.


## Morgan White

Morgan White joined the nuclear data team at LANL in X-division in 1998 as a 
summer student and has been part of that team ever since. As part of his 
doctoral thesis, Morgan implemented photo-nuclear physics in NJOY and MCNP to 
extend new capabilities to the radiation shielding community. Taking the advice 
start like you mean to continue, bringing better nuclear data and methods to 
users has been the focus of his work since. Morgan has been a part of 
developing the MCNP ACE data libraries ENDF60, LA150N, ENDF66, ACTI, ENDF70 and 
ENDF71 as well as many specialized libraries for specific applications. He has 
worked with Monte Carlo and deterministic neutronics codes as well as 
multi-physics applications to develop and implement extended capabilities in 
transport physics and tally capabilities. More recently, Morgan has crossed 
from simulations to the dark side and begun working with the experimental 
community to better understand and reduce the systematic errors in the 
fundamental data necessary for such simulations.

Cameron is a PhD candidate in Nuclear Engineering who works as a graduate 
student researcher on nuclear data experiment and simulation at Lawrence 
Berkeley National Laboratory.
