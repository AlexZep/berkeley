favorite (or not their favorite) text editor.

## Katy Huff : Vim-LaTeX

Vi (vim) has a lot of plugins. Katy's favorite way to discover plugins is
[VimAwesome](http://vimawesome.com). Her favorite way to then to install most
of those plugins is something called
[vim-pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

Among all of these plugins, the one that has made the most difference in the
life of Katy is [vim-latex](http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/). She owes this
knowledge to the great and wonderful RedBeard (@mrterry).
