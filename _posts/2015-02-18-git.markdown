39 people! Too many to count! We have arrived.


## Dav Clark

Dav Clark is the director of [Glass Bead Labs](http://bead.glass), is employed by the [D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu), and is supported by [BIDS](http://bids.berkeley.edu) and the [NIMH](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/). His mission is to provide inclusive access to Data Science training, with a particular focus on *social* scientists.

## Advanced Git

You may be keeping track of your work with git already. Learn some minimal skills, including the answer to "what's a pull request?" You'll get more done, both by managing your own work efficiently, and by effectively soliciting and incorporating work from others.

Dav has created a repository at [github.com/tech4measurement/tech4measurement.github.io](https://github.com/tech4measurement/tech4measurement.github.io). This repository uses jekyll to make a website. In order to change a thing or two about the website, folks make pull requests.

We'll be pretty interactive. Check out this [overview of resources](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/git-fundamentals), pull requests welcome.
