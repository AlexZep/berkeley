## Omoju Miller

[Omoju miller](omojumiller.com) is a PhD candidate at the University of
California at Berkeley researching artificial intelligence. She is also a
software technologist, start-up advisor, and educator.


## IPython

IPython is an interactive interpreter for programming with Python (and now many
other languages).

### Easy, Peasy, Lemon Squeezy

Omoju suggests that, to work, teach, or collaborate, development tools need to
be as easy as possible to install and use.

Things that she mentioned in this regard:

- IPython is easy to install with "pip." Just type `pip install ipython` in the
  terminal.
- [Wakari.io](wakari.io)
- [NBViewer](nbviewer.ipython.org)


### The Oscars

Omoju showed an example from [Mining the Social
Web](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition/tree/master/ipynb/)
about using the twitter api. She demonstrated how she was able to use

### LaTeX in Markdown cells

She demonstrated also how to include LaTeX in a markdown cell. First, create a
markdown cell, then include math:

```
Courtesy of MathJax, you can include mathematical expressions both inline:
$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$  and displayed:

$$e^x=\sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{1}{i!}x^i$$
```
