## Attending

- <++>


## Caroline Sofiatti

I'm a PhD Candidate in the physics department. I work for the Supernova Cosmology Group and our goal 
is to unravel the mysteries of Dark Energy, one data point at a time!   

## Sean Wahl

PhD Candidate in the Earth and planetary science department. I study planetary interiors 
using first-principles material simulations. I use matplotlib for both routine plotting
capability as well as for published journal figures.

## Matplotlib

The find the ipython notebook [here][matplotlib].

If you wish to follow allong with the presentation you should have Python 2 installed with the following packages:
* matplotlib
* numpy
* ipython
* basemap (optional)

## Seaborn

[Seaborn](https://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/index.html) is an awesome library for making beautiful and informative graphics in Python. Its mission
is to make visualization a central part of exploring and understanding data. Adding `import seaborn` to 
your code will not only make your plots look amazing, it will also make your life easier!!! 

Check out the IPython Notebook [here](https://github.com/sofiatti/my_thw_presentation). 

Code examples can be found [here][code].
