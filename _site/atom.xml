   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This was a planning meeting. Katy Huff, Ryan Bergmann, and Professor Rachel
Slaybaugh attended. Together we discussed a possible suite of useful software
practices to discuss this semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What is this?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discussed that part of the purpose of these meetings is to restart a
successful group that originated in Wisconsin, &amp;ldquo;The Hacker Within.&amp;rdquo; Ideally,
this meeting will facilitate sharing skills and best practices for
computational nuclear engineering applications. Last semester, we had a couple
such meetings. In spring semester I would like to share a number of skills for
scientific software development (testing, data management, version control,
literate programming etc. ) and to ask the rest of you to share the skills you
have as well. The goal will be to incorporate these practices into our
workflows. This would be a great venue for introducing new libraries, showing
off useful features of a neutronics code you&amp;rsquo;re using, or bringing up a
computational problem you&amp;rsquo;re having.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What can be expected?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to try meetings with an agenda structured thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, we will go around the room and attendees can introduce themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The meeting will start with one 30-40 minute talk on a topic of import to
scientists who use software.  Particular emphasis is likely to be paid to
topics useful to nuclear engineering researchers. To volunteer to give a talk,
mention it at a meeting, or &lt;a href-&quot;mailto:katyhuff@gmail.com&quot;&gt;email
Katy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The talk will be followed by a short period for questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For up to 40 minutes, attendees will have the opportunity to give lightning
talks on short topics. These may share a small skill snippet, demonstrate a
computational issue you&amp;rsquo;re having with you&amp;rsquo;re research, or anything of
interest to the group. Sometimes, lighting talk topics will be requested ahead
of time on a theme (i.e., text editors). To give a lightning talk, just show
up and speak up whe the time comes. If you like, letting Katy know ahead of
time is always welcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the meeting, attendees can hang around in the space and hack together on
their research codes, if they like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;What are the topics?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topics for the first part of the semester will focus on reproducibility:
&amp;ndash; command line
&amp;ndash; gpus/cuda&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;ndash; version control
&amp;ndash; build systems
&amp;ndash; testing
&amp;ndash; self documenting code
&amp;ndash; cloud computing (amazon ec2, etc.)
&amp;ndash; parallelism
&amp;ndash; profiling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Lightning Talks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of good topics were identified for lightning talks or talk series. If
you&amp;rsquo;re interested in talking about these or something else, just come prepared.
If the talk you want to give is in a series, consider banding together a group
of folks who would like to give the other parts of the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;libraries/linking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scripted plotting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exceptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;text editors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;licensing and export control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
