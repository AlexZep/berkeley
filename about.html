      <b>What: </b>
      </p>

      <p>
      This will be a weekly meeting for sharing skills and best practices for 
      computational nuclear engineering applications. This semester, we had a 
      couple such meetings. In spring semester I would like to share a number of 
      skills for scientific software development (testing, data management, 
      version control, literate programming etc. ) and to ask the rest of you to 
      share the skills you have as well. The goal will be to incorporate these 
      practices into our workflows. This would be a great venue for introducing 
      new libraries, showing off useful features of a neutronics code you're 
      using, or bringing up a computational problem you're having.

      <p>
      <b>Where: </b>
      </p>

      <p>
      2150 Shattuck, Suite 230
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Who:</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      Anyone interested in software development best practices is welcome to 
      come to our meetings. There will likely be a particular emphasis on 
      computational nuclear engineering, and neutronics analysis best practices. 
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>When:</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      Wednesdays at 4pm. The meeting should last one to two hours.
