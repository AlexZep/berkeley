      "Have you ever wondered what Python is made from? Did it crawl out of the primordial-ooze of assembly code directly into the beautiful high-level language that we love to use? Nope! In fact, the language itself is abstract, based on a set of rules and regulations, with a set of core libraries and concepts defined for each specific language version (e.g. 2.7.6 or 3.4.1). In order to actually be able to use the language, the Python language must be *implemented* according to this set of rules and regulations.\n",

      "What we usually think of as Python is actually a C-based implementation of the Python language, or CPython. There are other implementations of Python: [Jython](http://www.jython.org/), [IronPython](http://ironpython.net/) (Java-based), or [PyPy](http://pypy.org/) (RPython), but CPython is by far the largest and most commonly used.\n",
      "\n",
      "The set of tools, rules, and regulations for implementing Python in C is contained in the [Python/C API](https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/). One of the great things about Python as an open-source language is that the full API is freely available. In other words, you have access to the same exact stuff that the Python core developers do! In theory, there's nothing stopping you from implementing your own version of Python! (Keep in mind however that there have been dozens of core developers, plus thousands of brilliant contributors to CPython over 23 years... so you might want to hold off on starting over from scratch)\n",

      "This is where the idea of extending python comes from. Using the C/API (or higher-level toolkits that handle some of the trickier parts of the API for you) anybody can build their own C-extension than can then be used just like any other library in python. In this demo, we'll *very briefly* touch on a couple of tools that allow us to extend Python in this manner."

One of the worst things about the C/API is dealing with how python does memory management via **reference counting**.

It's not all cake and rainbows however; because all of the wrapping is being autogenerated for you, you don't necessarily know what is going on in that step.

The segmentation of the readouts gives us information about the 3D position of gamma-ray interactions within the detector, but also introduces an additional complication: every gamma-ray interaction within the sensitive volume of the detector will produce signals on multiple readout strips (see illustration). Ultimately, we want to reconstruct the location of the gamma-ray interaction within the detector from the strip responses. These particular detectors have a full charge-collection time of up to 250 ns, which means that any strips that collect charge within 250 ns of each other are likely to have resulted from a single gamma-ray interacting within the detector.\n",
