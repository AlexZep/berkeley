      <h2>What: </h2>
      <p>
      This is a weekly meeting for sharing skills and best practices for 
      scientific computation. In these friendly sessions, peers at all levels 
      of experience share topics useful in our scientific software development 
      workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
      This meeting would be a great venue for introducing new libraries, 
      showing off useful features of a scientific library or programming 
      language you're using, or bringing up a computational problem you're 
      having.
      </p>

      <h2>Where: </h2>

      <p>
      This meeting takes place at the <a 
        href="https://bids.berkeley.edu">Berkeley Institute for Data 
        Science.</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Room 190, Doe Library, The University of California - Berkeley
      </p>

      <h2>Who:</h2>
      <p>
      Anyone interested in software development best practices is welcome to 
      come to our meetings.
      </p>

      <h2>When:</h2>
      <p>
      Wednesdays at 4:00pm. While the main talk should occupy less than an hour, the 
      lightning talks and hacking session can go on until 6:00pm or later. See the 
      <a href="http://thehackerwithin.github.io/berkeley">blog</a> or the
      <a href="http://bit.ly/1cqFKuh">calendar</a> for the topic for this week.
      To keep up with meetings, you will want to  
      <a 
        href="https://calmail.berkeley.edu/manage/list/listinfo/ucb-hacker-within@lists.berkeley.edu">sign 
        up for the listhost</a>.
      </p>


      <h2>How:</h2>
      <p>
      Participating is really easy. 
      <li>At <b>4:00pm</b>, we gather and go through a round of introductions. 
      New faces are always appearing!</li>
      <li>Next, a volunteer will give a <b>tutorial</b> or lead a 
      <b>discussion</b> about a 
      computational topic. This topic can be anything useful, new, or 
      interesting to scientists who compute. It may be some new skill you have recently picked 
      up in your research, a productivity tool you have recently learned to love, an overview of a 
      useful library, or anything you feel we would enjoy learning.</li>
      <li>Finally, there will be a time for a couple of <b>Lightning Talks</b>, which 
      are 5-10 minute blasts of information about a particular topic or 
      question of interest to the group.
      <b>Note</b> that the lightning talk time is a good way to bring a 
      question to the group. If you have a bug you need help with, here's the 
      place to ask many ears about it at once.
      </li>

      The Hacker Within relies on peer-driven teaching, so please volunteer to 
      give of these talks. To do so, just ping the listhost by email at <a

      Based on The Hacker Within Scientific Computing 
      Group from the University of Wisconsin Madison, 
      Since Fall 2013, a Berkeley

      <h2>Why: </h2>
      <p>
      The tenets of scientiÔ¨Åc endeavor (e.g., data control, reproducibility, 
      comprehensive documentation, and peer review) suffer in projects that fail 
      to make use of current development tools such as unit testing, version 
      control, automated documentation, and others.</p>
      <p>
      To avoid these pitfalls, this weekly meeting exists for sharing skills and best practices for 
      computational scientific applications. This group is modeled after The 
      Hacker Within, which  began as a student organization at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and 
      is now reborn as a collection of such chapters around the world. Each of 
      the chapters convenes a community of scientists, at all levels of their 
      education and training, to share their knowledge and best practices in 
      using computing to accomplish their work.</p>
